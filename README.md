## Features

### How It Works

The AI search uses a two-stage pipeline for optimal performance and accuracy:

#### Stage 1: Vector Similarity Search
- Query converted to 384-dimensional vector embedding
- AWS RDS PostgreSQL pgvector searches ALL resumes in database
- Returns top 200 most semantically similar candidates (configurable)
- **Fast:** 3-5 seconds even with 500+ candidates
- Cosine similarity distance operator for relevance ranking

#### Stage 2: GPT-4o-mini Batch Analysis
- Top 200 candidates divided into batches of 15
- Concurrent batch processing for optimal performance
- AI analyzes resume text for course-specific qualifications
- Strict confidence scoring with direct experience requirements
- Returns candidates with:
  - **Confidence score** (1-5, only 4+ shown to users)
  - **Detailed reasoning** (max 120 characters)
  - **Pre-signed S3 resume URL** (7-day expiration)
  - **Applicant metadata** (name, email, notes)

### Semantic Understanding

The system understands meaning, not just keywords:

**Query:** "Cyber Law"

**Will Find:**
- "Data privacy attorney"
- "Cybersecurity compliance expert"
- "GDPR specialist"
- "Information security counsel"
- "Technology law practice"

**Won't Match:**
- "Tax law"
- "Real estate attorney"
- "Family law practice"

### Performance
- **Search 200 candidates:** 3-5 seconds
- **Search 500 candidates:** 4-6 seconds
- **Search 1,000 candidates:** 5-8 seconds
- **No GPU required:** Runs on CPU with @xenova/transformers
- **Scales to 10,000+** with proper IVFFlat indexing
- **Batch concurrency:** Processes multiple batches in parallel
- **AWS RDS:** Managed database with automatic scaling

---

## Database Architecture

### Tables

#### `applicants`
```sql
applicant_id    SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
name            VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL
email           VARCHAR(200) UNIQUE NOT NULL
phone           VARCHAR(50)
note            TEXT
created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
```

#### `resumes`
```sql
resume_id           SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
applicant_id        INT REFERENCES applicants(applicant_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
resume_file         VARCHAR(500)  -- S3 URL format
cover_letter_file   VARCHAR(500)  -- S3 URL format
extracted_text      TEXT
embedding           vector(384)
uploaded_at         TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
```

**Example S3 URL:** `https://resume-storage-tamu-law.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/john_doe_resume.pdf`

### Vector Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX resumes_embedding_idx 
  ON resumes USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

**Performance Note:** IVFFlat index provides fast approximate nearest neighbor search for 1000+ candidates.

### AWS Infrastructure
- **RDS Connection:** SSL/TLS encryption with `sslmode=no-verify` for AWS RDS self-signed certificates
- **Connection Pooling:** pg.Pool for efficient database connection management
- **S3 Integration:** Direct file uploads with AWS SDK v3
- **Pre-signed URLs:** Temporary 7-day access links generated on-demand

### Relationships
- One-to-one: One applicant → One resume
- CASCADE delete: Deleting applicant removes resume
- Email uniqueness enforced at database level

---

## Vector Embeddings

### Technology Stack
- **pgvector:** PostgreSQL extension for vector operations
- **@xenova/transformers:** Local embedding generation
- **Model:** all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dimensions)
- **No GPU required:** Runs on CPU efficiently

### Embedding Generation
Automatic on upload:
```javascript
PDF → Extract Text → Generate Embedding → Upload to S3 → Store URL & Embedding in RDS
```

For existing resumes (if needed):
```bash
node generate-embeddings.js
```

**AWS Integration:**
- Files uploaded directly to S3 using AWS SDK v3
- S3 URLs stored in database (`resume_file`, `cover_letter_file`)
- Pre-signed URLs generated on-demand for secure access
- 7-day expiration (604,800 seconds, maximum for SigV4)

### Similarity Search
```sql
SELECT * FROM resumes
ORDER BY embedding <=> $queryEmbedding
LIMIT 50
```

Uses cosine similarity to find most relevant candidates.

## Troubleshooting

### Port 5432 Already in Use
If you have PostgreSQL running locally:

1. Edit `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "55432:5432"  # Changed from 5432:5432
```

2. Update `server/.env`:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://tamu:secret@localhost:55432/law_portal
```

3. Restart:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Database Connection Refused
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs db

# Restart if needed
docker-compose restart db
```

### "extension vector is not available"
Ensure you're using the pgvector image in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
image: pgvector/pgvector:pg16
```

### Embedding Generation is Slow
First-time model download (~50MB) takes 30-60 seconds. Subsequent operations are fast.

### No Candidates Found
Check if resumes have embeddings:
```sql
docker-compose exec db psql -U tamu -d law_portal -c \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM resumes WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL;"
```

Generate missing embeddings:
```bash
cd server
node generate-embeddings.js
```

### OpenAI API Errors
- **401:** Invalid API key in `.env`
- **429:** Rate limit exceeded, wait and retry
- **500:** Check server logs for details

### Reset Database (Delete All Data)
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

This recreates the database with fresh schema.tional adjunct application form with validation and file uploads.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FA25-CSCE482-capstone/github-setup-tamu-law.git
cd github-setup-tamu-law
```

### 2. Setup Environment Variables

**Frontend** (`frontend/.env`):
```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set:
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

**Server** (`server/.env`):
```bash
cd ../server
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@your-rds-endpoint.amazonaws.com:5432/law_portal?ssl=true&sslmode=no-verify
PORT=4000
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
AWS_REGION=us-east-2
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name
SEARCH_LIMIT=200
```

**AWS Credentials** (for S3 access):
```bash
# Configure AWS CLI credentials (if not already done)
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID
# Enter your AWS Secret Access Key
# Default region: us-east-2
# Default output format: json
```

**Note:** The application uses AWS SDK v3 which automatically reads credentials from `~/.aws/credentials`

### 3. Start the Database (Docker)
```bash
# From project root
docker-compose up -d

# Verify it's running (should show "healthy")
docker-compose ps
```

### Quick start for teammates (reproduce DB with sample data)

If your teammates have the same `docker-compose.yml`, they can reproduce the exact database state used in this repo by using the SQL dump placed in `db/init/002_data.sql`.

1. Make sure the dump file is present in the repo (it should be at `db/init/002_data.sql`).
2. Remove any existing DB volume (this will delete local data):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

3. Start the stack. On first start the Postgres image will run all scripts in `db/init/` and initialize with the schema + data from `002_data.sql`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Verify DB is healthy and the data is present:

```bash
docker-compose exec db psql -U tamu -d law_portal -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM applicants;"
docker-compose exec db psql -U tamu -d law_portal -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM resumes;"
```

Notes:
- This approach requires a fresh DB volume because the docker-entrypoint-initdb.d scripts only run on first initialization.
- The schema includes pgvector extension creation for semantic search. The Docker image used is `pgvector/pgvector:pg16`.

The database uses the **pgvector/pgvector:pg16** image with vector extensions enabled.

### 4. Install and Start Server
```bash
cd server
npm install
node src/index.js
```

Server will run on `http://localhost:4000`

**First-time setup:** The server will automatically download the embedding model (~50MB) on first run.

### 5. Install and Start Frontend
```bash
# In a new terminal
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`

### 6. Generate Embeddings (If Existing Data)
If you have existing resumes without embeddings:
```bash
cd server
node generate-embeddings.js
```

### Quick Test
- Visit `http://localhost:4000/health` - Should show database connected
- Visit `http://localhost:5173` - Should show the login page
- Visit `http://localhost:5173/chatbot` - AI chatbot interface
